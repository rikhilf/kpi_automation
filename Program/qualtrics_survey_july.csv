"I believe that at times, there was not a clear resolution on certain things between us and the IT group. 

1- I stated that we need the current site completely overhauled and a number of new tabs added. But this was not caught by the IT folks. and they thought the site woudl have the same tabs as previously. This caused a difference in estimate for fee. But it was fine for additional fees to be spent bc I knew this was a huge effort. 

2- As we worked, at times the IT staff moved forward when I did not realize they woudl. This was not appropriate at time bc the final version had not yet been confirmed. This was likely again a communication issue . I did not understand her process for developing the site... and she did not understand the process I had to go through for document approval. This caused a repeat of work. It improved when others workign on the project were removed and it was the IT person and myself workign to finish off the site. 

Despite these issues... we are extremely please with the results AND very impressed with the job that Ivy did. She was good about giving things a try that we a were uncertain on how to do it. And if she did not know the answer, she searched it out for us. I am confident in recommending your group to those who need extensive help as we did.

When doing projects will outside companies it would be a good idea to check to see if the project is up and running to the standards of your department. Don't wait until they are done because this would save a lot of time having you going back to fix something that doesn't work or having them come back. Do trial runs. Your department is the ones who know how the equipment should function because that is your expertise. If you have to pay your staff overtime it will be worth it in the end.
